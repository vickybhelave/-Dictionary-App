This project is a simple and user-friendly Dictionary App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 The application allows users to search for any English word and instantly view its meaning, part of speech, 
and pronunciation. It also provides Hindi translations along with a text-to-speech feature so that users can listen to the word in Hindi.
 Example sentences and synonyms are also displayed when available, making the app useful for learners who want to improve their English vocabulary.
 The design is clean and responsive, with a modern gradient background and a centered search box for easy usage on both desktop and mobile devices.
 The app uses the free Dictionary API to fetch meanings and examples,
 and the MyMemory Translation API for Hindi translations, while Googleâ€™s Text-to-Speech service is used for Hindi audio output. 
This project is a good example of combining multiple APIs to create a practical learning tool, 
and it can be further improved by adding more language support, offline features, or saving searched words for quick access.
